# Crypto_Cluster
Clustering Crypto by performance in different time periods
The libraries used for this challenge are pandas, hvplot, pathlib, PCA, KMeans, and StandardScaler.
I started the challenge by importing our csv data, we then generated the summary statistics, followed by plotting our dataframe to get a better understanding of the data.
I then prepared the data using StandardScaler and cleaned it using pandas
After cleaning the data I created an elbow curve in order to find the optimal value for our model.
Once the best value for K has been found, we start clustering the data using the KMeans method, followed by plotting the data in a scatter plot.
Next I optimized the data with the PCA method in order to find the best value for K, I then plotted the data into an elbow curve in order to better understand the data.
I then clustered the data from the PCA method using the KMeans method and plotted a scatter plot in order to better understand the data. 
Then I plotted both elbow curves next to each other using a composite plot and analyzed which elbow curve was better for analyzing the data.
Finally I plotted both the scatter plots next to each other using a composite plot and analyzed with scatter plot gave me more detailed information.
